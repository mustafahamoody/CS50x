Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

As the number of simulations ran increased, the results yielded from the simulation increased not only in accuracy but in numbers as well.
Considering the placement of the top five teams, the prediction with N = 10, as well as N = 100 proved incorrect,
as the listed rankings were: 1. Belgium, 2. Brazil, 3. Switzerland, 4. Argentina, 5. Spain,
and 1. Belgium, 2. Brazil, 3. Portugal, 4. Argentina, 5. Switzerland respectively.
This is opposed to every prediction with N = 1000 +, which yielded the top 5 winners as: 1. Belgium, 2.Brazil, 3. Portugal, 4. Spain, 5. Switzerland


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

As examined in the preceding answer, the list of the top five winners did not change after N was set to 1000.
So after testing the results with N = 1000, when testing that N = 10 000 yielded practically the same results for the top 12 teams (same order of winners, with an almost negligible difference in chance of winning),
I would have called the predictions "good enough".
